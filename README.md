## Before using the payloads

Your Pico should already have been flashed with the adafruit circuit python file, so it can interpret ducky script to python. 
Remember to also make the Pico an HID device, or else it will not work. 

Watch a tutorial on it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_f9p-_JWZw&t=917s

## How to use the payloads
Download the .dd file and add it into your root directory in the Raspberry Pi Pico. It will run as soon as the .dd file has been copied over, so remember to be quick to plug the usb out. 

To edit the payload, download the .txt file. Make your changes there and save it as an "payload.dd" file. Remember to click the "All files" on the file type while saving the notepad note, or else it will save as an .txt and not work.

The payloads list will be updated as soon as I add in more payloads. For the most part it will be custom payloads because you can find almost any payload you need [here](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payloads).
